# .Net Core Samples

A collection of simple applications using .NET Core. The console applications will run on any OS with .NET core, however the WinForms applications require Windows.

Most of these applications are just silly applications that I wrote a long time ago (In C# 2005/2008), or ones from excercise books (again, from 2005/2008). I found them while cleaning out some old DVDs and backups. I figured why not bring them into the modern age and update them with some of the new C# things I have learned.

The console applications can be built from command line, the windows forms apps require Visual Studio.
